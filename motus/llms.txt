# Motus

Motus is revolutionizing sales coaching by replacing time-consuming manual call reviews with automated, intelligent feedback delivered in seconds. Our mission is to empower sales teams to pinpoint the exact moments that win or lose deals, providing the kind of insightful feedback that top performers would offer, all without the need to watch a single recording. We deliver proven advice and identify subtle yet critical deal-killing moments, enabling reps to course-correct rapidly and close more business.

## What We Do

At Motus, we understand the challenges sales leaders and reps face daily. Most sales calls go unreviewed due to severe time constraints, leading to missed opportunities for valuable feedback and uncorrected mistakes. This often leaves reps repeating the same errors, while managers are too busy managing the pipeline to intervene effectively. Without proper guidance, reps are left guessing, and so are you, about what truly impacts performance. Motus steps in to fill this critical gap, ensuring that no valuable learning opportunity is dropped. Our platform is designed to provide immediate, actionable insights, so you can quickly understand and rectify mistakes, eliminating the need for tedious replays. To experience the power of automated call review, you can [Start For Free](https://app.motustech.io) today.

## Our Core Capabilities

Motus is built to accurately review your sales calls, providing the precise feedback you need without the manual effort. We focus on the small, often overlooked moments that ultimately determine the success or failure of a deal. It's not that your reps aren't trying; they're simply not catching what truly matters. Our platform helps you identify and address these crucial moments before they lead to lost deals.

### Intelligent Call Analysis

Our system is modeled after the strategies of top sales performers, delivering proven advice that helps reps course-correct fast. We don't just transcribe; we analyze the nuances of conversation.

*   **Catches Repeat Mistakes**: Motus is adept at spotting recurring patterns, such as rushing pricing discussions or skipping critical pain points, flagging them early before they become ingrained habits.
*   **Silent Signals Detection**: We excel at identifying subtle cues that are often hard for humans to catch, like when a prospect hesitates or loses interest halfway through a conversation.
*   **Emotional Tone Shifts**: Our technology identifies changes in emotional tone that indicate buyer sentiment, helping reps understand the underlying feelings of their prospects.
*   **Missed Opportunity Flagging**: Motus flags missed opportunities to address objections or capitalize on buying signals, ensuring no potential deal-closing moment is overlooked.

### Preventing Subtle Deal Killers

Many deals don't spectacularly blow up; they slowly fall apart due to a series of small missteps. These can include talking over customer concerns instead of addressing them, missing emotional cues that indicate hesitation, or failing to follow up on key questions that reveal buying intent. Motus helps you catch these subtle deal killers by:

*   Identifying emotional tone shifts that indicate buyer sentiment.
*   Flagging missed opportunities to address objections.
*   Helping you catch those critical moments, so you can prevent lost deals before they happen.

### Actionable Call Timeline

Our intuitive call analysis provides a detailed timeline of key moments within a conversation, offering precise feedback at specific timestamps. This allows for targeted coaching and rapid improvement. For instance, a call timeline might highlight:

*   **Engagement Decreased (e.g., 5:24)**: Notifying that customer interest dropped during a technical explanation, suggesting the use of simpler language.
*   **Buying Signal Detected (e.g., 8:42)**: Pointing out that a customer mentioned budget approval, indicating a missed chance to discuss next steps.
*   **Effective Value Statement (e.g., 11:15)**: Highlighting a strong ROI explanation that resonated with the customer, encouraging the rep to use this approach more often.

This granular feedback empowers reps to understand exactly where they can improve and what they did well. Discover more about our analytical depth on our [Solutions page](https://motustech.io/solutions).
