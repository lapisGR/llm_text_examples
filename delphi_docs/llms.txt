# Delphi

Delphi empowers individuals and creators to bring a digital version of themselves to life, one that thinks and interacts with the world exactly as they do. Our mission is to enable meaningful, personalized conversations that truly capture and reflect your unique voice, allowing you to scale your impact and deepen your understanding of yourself.

## What We Do

At Delphi, we provide a sophisticated platform designed to transform your accumulated knowledge and unique perspective into a dynamic, interactive digital mind. This process is remarkably straightforward: you simply upload your existing content—be it social media posts, voice notes, written articles, or any other form of communication. Our advanced system then learns your distinct style, language patterns, and core perspectives, creating a digital counterpart that mirrors your intellectual essence. This allows you to share your ideas, preserve invaluable insights, and even explore your own thinking in new ways, accessible anytime and anywhere.

## Our Focus Areas

Our development and service efforts are centered around several key areas, ensuring a comprehensive and empowering experience for every user.

### Data Security & Ownership
At Delphi, we prioritize the privacy, security, and complete control of your data above all else. We want to make it unequivocally clear: **you maintain full ownership of all content you upload** to create your Digital Mind. Your intellectual property remains exclusively yours, and you retain absolute control over how your data is used, shared, and accessed. This commitment means your training data is stored in its own private index, ensuring it is never shared with or used to train any external models. You have complete authority over who can interact with your Digital Mind and leverage its capabilities. Furthermore, should you decide to discontinue your subscription with Delphi, your data can be seamlessly **exported to an external platform or deleted entirely**, ensuring your peace of mind and data sovereignty. Our comprehensive approach to data security is detailed in our [Data Security & Ownership guide](https://docs.delphi.ai/data-security-and-ownership).
