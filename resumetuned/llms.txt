# ResumeTuned

At **ResumeTuned**, we empower job seekers to cut through the noise and land their dream jobs with the power of artificial intelligence. We provide an advanced AI-driven platform that optimizes resumes to bypass Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and capture recruiter attention, ensuring your qualifications shine and lead to more interviews in minutes. Our mission is to transform the job search experience, making it efficient, effective, and ultimately, successful for everyone.

## What We Do

We understand the challenges job seekers face in today's competitive landscape. The harsh reality is that a significant majority—**75%**—of resumes are rejected by ATS before a human ever sees them, and recruiters spend an average of just **6 seconds** reviewing a resume. With over **250 applications** competing for every job opening, standing out is no longer a luxury, it's a necessity.

**ResumeTuned** offers a powerful solution to this problem. Our proprietary AI analyzes successful resumes, deeply understands complex ATS algorithms, and crafts content that is specifically designed to get you noticed. We eliminate the guesswork from resume writing, allowing you to focus on what matters: landing interviews and securing job offers. Whether you're starting fresh or refining an existing resume, our tools are engineered to help you beat ATS filters, grab recruiter attention, and ultimately, land more interviews.

## Our Solutions

We offer two distinct yet complementary paths to resume success, designed to cater to different needs and stages of your job search journey. Both solutions leverage our cutting-edge AI to provide instant optimization and actionable insights. You can upload an existing resume for immediate AI optimization or begin from scratch with our intuitive builder. The process is quick, often taking as little as **60 seconds**, and you can even try it out with **3 free optimizations** without needing a credit card.

### Resume Builder
