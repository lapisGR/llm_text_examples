# Torsor - AI agents for document assembly and drafting

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for **Torsor**, an innovative platform leveraging advanced AI agents to revolutionize document assembly and drafting. In today's fast-paced professional environments, the creation of complex, customized documents often consumes significant time and resources, leading to bottlenecks and potential human error. Torsor addresses this critical challenge by transforming the traditional, manual process into an efficient, automated workflow.

Torsor's core value proposition lies in its ability to **learn from your firm's existing documents**—including templates and samples—and then autonomously assemble and draft future documents with unparalleled speed and accuracy. This intelligent automation not only drastically reduces the time spent on document creation, often from hours to mere minutes, but also ensures consistency, compliance, and high quality across all generated outputs. It's designed for businesses, particularly those in legal, finance, and other document-intensive sectors, seeking to scale their operations without compromising on precision or increasing overheads.

This documentation provides a deep dive into Torsor's capabilities, its underlying technology, and practical guidance on how to integrate and utilize its powerful AI agents. Whether you're a developer looking to integrate Torsor into your existing systems via our robust API, or a business user aiming to streamline your document workflows, you'll find the necessary information to harness the full potential of Torsor for intelligent document automation.

## Core Concept: AI-Powered Document Assembly and Drafting {#core-concept}

Torsor is built on the principle of **intelligent automation** for document creation. Unlike traditional templating systems that rely solely on predefined placeholders, Torsor employs sophisticated AI agents to understand the *context*, *structure*, and *conditional logic* embedded within your firm's existing documents. This allows it to go beyond simple data merging, enabling the dynamic assembly and drafting of highly customized and contextually relevant documents.

At its heart, Torsor operates through a two-phase process: **learning** and **generation**. The learning phase involves Torsor's AI models ingesting and analyzing your firm's proprietary document sets, effectively building a knowledge base of your specific drafting patterns, clauses, and variations. The generation phase then leverages this learned intelligence to produce new documents that are not just filled templates, but intelligently drafted outputs tailored to specific client needs or case requirements.

> **Key Benefit:** Torsor significantly reduces the human effort involved in repetitive document drafting, minimizes errors, and ensures brand and legal consistency across all outputs. This frees up valuable professional time, allowing your team to focus on higher-value strategic tasks.

### The Torsor Learning Engine {#learning-engine}

The **Torsor Learning Engine** is the proprietary AI backbone that enables the platform's unique capabilities. It utilizes a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP), machine learning, and pattern recognition algorithms to extract insights from your documents.

*   **Contextual Understanding:** The engine analyzes the semantic relationships between different sections, clauses, and data points within your documents. It understands *why* certain clauses are used under specific conditions.
*   **Structural Inference:** It identifies common document structures, headings, sub-sections, and formatting patterns, allowing it to replicate your firm's unique document style.
*   **Conditional Logic Recognition:** Crucially, the engine learns the implicit rules and conditions that govern the inclusion or exclusion of specific text blocks or clauses. For example, it can learn that a certain paragraph is only included if a client is in a specific jurisdiction or if a transaction exceeds a certain value.
*   **Dynamic Variable Mapping:** Beyond simple variable replacement, the engine understands how data points influence the surrounding text and can adapt phrasing accordingly.

This deep learning process allows Torsor to create a dynamic model of your firm's document drafting intelligence, making it far more powerful than conventional merge tools.

## How Torsor Works: The Two-Step Process {#how-torsor-works}

Torsor simplifies complex document automation into a straightforward, two-step workflow: **Teach Torsor** and **Generate Documents**. This intuitive process ensures that even non-technical users can quickly onboard and leverage the platform's capabilities.

### Step 1: Teach Torsor {#teach-torsor}

The initial setup phase involves training Torsor's AI agents with your firm's unique document intelligence. This is a one-time setup that typically takes around **5 minutes** per document type, depending on complexity.

#### Process Overview

1.  **Provide Templates:** Upload your firm's standard document templates. These serve as the foundational structure and boilerplate text.
2.  **Supply Samples:** Crucially, provide a diverse set of *completed* sample documents based on those templates. These samples, ideally representing various scenarios and data inputs, are what Torsor's AI learns from. The more varied and representative the samples, the more robust and intelligent Torsor's learned model becomes.
3.  **Torsor Learns:** The Torsor Learning Engine ingests these documents, analyzes the patterns, extracts conditional logic, and builds a comprehensive understanding of your document assembly rules. This process creates a "Document Intelligence Model" specific to your firm.

#### Technical Details & Best Practices

*   **Supported Formats:** Torsor primarily supports `DOCX` (Microsoft Word) for templates and samples, as it allows for rich text formatting and structural analysis. PDF and image-based documents can also be used, but `DOCX` provides the richest learning experience.
*   **Data Privacy & Security:** All documents uploaded to Torsor are processed within a secure, encrypted environment. Torsor is designed with enterprise-grade security measures, ensuring that your sensitive firm data remains confidential and compliant with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA). Data is used solely for the purpose of training your specific Document Intelligence Models and is never shared or used to train models for other clients.
*   **Optimal Sample Quantity:** While Torsor can learn from a few samples, providing 5-10 diverse samples per template is recommended for optimal intelligence. These samples should showcase different conditional clauses, variable inputs, and structural variations.
*   **API for Programmatic Teaching:** For firms with large repositories of documents or complex integration needs, Torsor offers an API endpoint to programmatically upload templates and samples.


### Step 2: Generate Documents {#generate-documents}

Once Torsor has learned from your documents, generating new, customized documents becomes an incredibly fast and efficient process. This phase typically takes around **3 minutes** per document and incurs a cost of **$4-10** per generated document, depending on complexity and length.

#### Process Overview

1.  **Provide Input Data:** Supply the specific data points relevant to the new document you wish to create (e.g., client name, case details, financial figures, specific conditions). This data can be provided via a simple JSON payload or through a user-friendly interface.
2.  **Torsor Processes:** Torsor's AI agents leverage the previously learned Document Intelligence Model. They analyze your input data, apply the recognized conditional logic, populate variables, and dynamically assemble the document, ensuring all formatting and structural rules are adhered to.
3.  **Complete Document:** Torsor outputs the fully drafted and formatted document in your desired format.

#### Technical Details & Output Formats

*   **Input Data Structure:** Input data is typically provided as a JSON object, where keys correspond to the variables and conditions Torsor has learned to recognize.
*   **Output Formats:**
    *   `PDF`: Ideal for final, immutable documents.
    *   `IMG`: Useful for embedding document snippets or specific pages into other applications.
    *   `DOCX`: Allows for further manual edits if necessary, maintaining full fidelity to the original template's styling.
*   **API for Programmatic Generation:** The primary method for generating documents is through Torsor's RESTful API, allowing seamless integration into existing CRM, ERP, or case management systems.
