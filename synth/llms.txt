# Synth

**Synth** is an advanced observability and error analysis platform designed specifically for AI agents. Founded by Josh, our mission is simple: help you build and deploy better AI agents. We make it easy to discover, understand, and action issues that your AI agent faces - whether in evaluation settings or in production. By reviewing the logs of how your AI agent makes calls with AI models and the responses it gets, we transform complex debugging into straightforward problem-solving.

## What We Do

At **Synth**, we specialize in providing comprehensive monitoring and analysis tools for AI agent development. We capture every interaction between your agents and AI models, automatically analyze patterns, and surface actionable insights. Our platform goes beyond simple logging - we understand the context of each call, cluster similar errors, and provide both high-level summaries and detailed raw data access. Whether you're building a reasoning-and-action agent for gaming or deploying complex production systems, **Synth** gives you the visibility you need.

## Simplifying AI Agent Development

**Synth** transforms the challenging task of debugging AI agents into a streamlined process. We provide drop-in replacements for OpenAI and Anthropic clients in Python, requiring just a few decorators to start collecting valuable data. Our intelligent analysis then helps you understand agent behavior at scale.

### Easy Integration, Powerful Analysis

Getting started with **Synth** takes minutes, not hours. Our Python SDKs work as drop-in replacements for existing AI clients. Add simple decorators like `@track_messages` around your AI calls, specify an agent identifier, and you're ready to collect comprehensive trace data. Our system automatically understands what each call is doing, building a complete picture of your agent's behavior and decision-making process.

### Automated Error Detection & Clustering

**Synth** automatically identifies and groups recurring problems across your agent traces. For instance, if your Minecraft-playing agent repeatedly attempts to craft items without sufficient resources, we'll detect this pattern, show you exactly when and where it occurs, and help you understand the root cause. Our clustering algorithms surface the most significant issues, saving you from manually reviewing thousands of logs.

### Intelligent Data Exploration Tools

Beyond automated analysis, **Synth** offers multiple ways to explore your agent data. Our dashboard provides enriched summaries and trace visualization. When you need deeper insights, chat with your data using our AI-powered interface for quick queries, or deploy our specialized sifter agent - equipped with vector search and advanced tools - for complex analysis across large datasets. This flexibility ensures you can always find the answers you need, whether through high-level overviews or detailed instance examination.

## Built for Real-World AI Development

**Synth** addresses the real challenges developers face when building AI agents. Our platform saves hours of manual log analysis, helps catch issues before they impact users, and provides the insights needed for continuous improvement. From evaluation to production, **Synth** gives you the observability and control essential for reliable AI systems.

As Josh says: "I think it's going to make debugging and improving your agent a lot easier over the baseline of just sifting through log data yourself." Experience the difference at https://synth-a7a3d3e9.mintlify.app.
