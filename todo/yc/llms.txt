# Y Combinator

At **Y Combinator**, we are dedicated to helping founders "make something people want." We are a startup accelerator that provides seed funding, advice, and connections to early-stage companies, transforming innovative ideas into successful businesses. Our mission is to empower the next generation of entrepreneurs by offering a unique program designed to accelerate growth and foster a vibrant community.

## Our Mission and Approach

Our core philosophy is simple yet profound: **make something people want**. This guiding principle underpins everything we do, from the companies we select to the advice we provide. We believe that by focusing intensely on user needs and building products that genuinely solve problems, startups can achieve remarkable success. We invest in a wide range of companies across various sectors, always seeking founders with bold visions and the drive to execute. Our program is designed to provide the essential tools, mentorship, and network necessary for startups to navigate the challenging early stages of development and scale effectively.

## How We Support Startups

We run a highly selective accelerator program that culminates in **Demo Day**, where our companies present their progress to a curated audience of investors. Our support extends far beyond initial funding; we immerse founders in a rigorous program focused on product development, market fit, fundraising strategies, and team building.

Our program typically operates in **batches**, with applications opening for upcoming cycles like the **F2025 batch**. Founders interested in joining our community can learn more and apply through our dedicated application portal. We also provide comprehensive resources like the **YC Interview Guide** and a detailed **FAQ** to help prospective founders understand our process and prepare their applications. Our goal is to equip founders with the knowledge and confidence to build enduring companies. We offer direct advice, facilitate peer-to-peer learning within the batch, and connect founders with a vast network of experienced mentors and alumni.
