## Key Features & Value Proposition{#key-features-value-proposition}

Tour.video functions as an all-encompassing solution for modern property leasing, offering a suite of features designed to enhance every stage of the prospect journey from initial interest to lease signing. Its primary aim is to automate and scale the personalized engagement typically provided by a human leasing agent.

### Virtual Leasing Agent Capabilities{#virtual-leasing-agent-capabilities}

At its heart, Tour.video acts as a **virtual leasing agent**, capable of handling inquiries, guiding prospects through properties, and nurturing leads around the clock. This significantly reduces the burden on human staff, allowing them to focus on high-value interactions.

*   **24/7 Availability**: Engage website visitors at any time, regardless of office hours.
*   **Scalability**: Handle an unlimited number of simultaneous tours and inquiries without additional staffing.
*   **Consistency**: Deliver a consistent, high-quality tour experience every time.

### Core Components of the Tour.video Platform{#core-components-of-the-tour-video-platform}

Tour.video is built upon several interconnected components that work in synergy to deliver its powerful capabilities:

*   **Interactive Video Tours**:
    These are not just static videos. Tour.video enables the creation of **guided video experiences** that incorporate interactive elements. Prospects can navigate through different rooms, click on hotspots for more information, and engage with calls-to-action (CTAs) directly within the video. This dynamic approach keeps viewers engaged and allows them to explore at their own pace, mimicking a personalized in-person tour.
    > **Best Practice**: Design tours that highlight key selling points of each unit or amenity. Use clear, concise narration and strategically placed CTAs to guide the prospect.

*   **Questions & Lead Capture**:
    Throughout the interactive tour, Tour.video can prompt prospects with questions to gather valuable information, qualify their interest, and capture their contact details. This data is crucial for subsequent personalized follow-ups.
    *   **Customizable Forms**: Tailor questions to gather specific prospect preferences (e.g., desired move-in date, number of bedrooms, budget).
    *   **Progressive Profiling**: Collect information incrementally to avoid overwhelming prospects.

*   **AI Follow-ups**:
    A cornerstone of Tour.video's automation, the AI follow-up system ensures that no lead falls through the cracks. Based on prospect interactions during the tour and their provided information, the AI can trigger personalized email or SMS sequences. These communications can include:
    *   Recaps of the toured unit.
    *   Links to schedule a live tour or apply.
    *   Answers to common questions.
    *   Information about special offers.
    This intelligent nurturing significantly increases the likelihood of conversion.

*   **Video Ads Integration**:
    Extend the reach of your interactive tours by repurposing segments or entire tours into compelling video advertisements. This allows for consistent branding and messaging across various marketing channels, driving more qualified traffic back to your website and Tour.video experiences.

## Getting Started: Integration & Embedding{#getting-started-integration-embedding}

Integrating Tour.video into your existing website is designed to be a quick and straightforward process, typically taking less than five minutes. The primary method involves embedding a lightweight JavaScript snippet, which then dynamically loads your interactive tours.

### Embedding the Tour.video Player{#embedding-the-tour-video-player}

To display Tour.video content on your webpage, you simply need to include a single `<script>` tag in your HTML. This script will handle the rendering of your interactive tours.

#### Basic Embed Code

Place the following script tag within the `<body>` section of your HTML, ideally just before the closing `</body>` tag, or within the `<head>` section if asynchronous loading is preferred.

```html
<script src="https://tour.video/embed.js"></script>
```

Once this script is loaded, Tour.video's system will detect designated elements on your page (e.g., `div` elements with specific `data-` attributes) and automatically inject the interactive tour player.

#### Configuration and Customization

While the basic embed works out-of-the-box, you can often customize the behavior or appearance of the embedded tour using `data-` attributes on a container element or through a global configuration object.

For example, to embed a specific tour, you might use a `div` element with a `data-tour-id` attribute:

```html
<div data-tour-video-player data-tour-id="YOUR_TOUR_ID_HERE"></div>
<script src="https://tour.video/embed.js"></script>
```

> **Note**: Replace `YOUR_TOUR_ID_HERE` with the unique ID of the tour you wish to embed, which can be obtained from your Tour.video dashboard. Specific `data-` attributes and their values will be detailed within your Tour.video account's integration section.

#### Asynchronous Loading

For optimal page load performance, it is recommended to load the embed script asynchronously. This prevents the script from blocking the rendering of other page content.

```html
<script async src="https://tour.video/embed.js"></script>
```

### Integration with Property Management Systems (PMS){#integration-with-property-management-systems}

*   **Automated Data Sync**: Synchronize unit availability, pricing, and prospect information between Tour.video and your PMS.
*   **Lead Management**: Automatically push qualified leads captured by Tour.video directly into your PMS's lead management system.

*   **Conversion Funnel Analysis**: Visualize where prospects drop off in the tour or follow-up process, allowing for continuous optimization.

*   **Direct Booking**: Eliminates friction in the booking process, increasing conversion rates for live interactions.
