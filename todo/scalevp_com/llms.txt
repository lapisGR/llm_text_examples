We believe in the power of software to drive efficiency and innovation across industries, and we bring a record of success in helping companies scale from early growth to market leadership.

## Where We Invest

Our investment strategy centers on identifying and supporting companies that are shaping the future of enterprise software. We focus on specific market areas where we see significant potential for growth and disruption through intelligent applications and infrastructure. We partner with founders who are building category-defining products in these dynamic sectors.

### AI Apps
We invest in applications that are fundamentally powered by artificial intelligence, transforming workflows and decision-making within businesses. These companies are building intelligent agents, automation tools, and predictive platforms that deliver significant value. Examples from our portfolio include **Bland** (AI phone calling agents), **Klarity** (AI for finance and accounting), **Tavus** (AI video generation), and **Regie.ai** (AI sales automation).

### Fintech
Our focus in Fintech is on software companies that are innovating within the financial services ecosystem, particularly those serving businesses. This includes payments, financial operations, risk management, and compliance solutions that leverage technology for greater efficiency and security. Portfolio companies like **Bill.com** (digital business payments), **Socure** (identity verification), and **Forter** (fraud prevention) represent our commitment to this area.

### Infrastructure
We back companies building the foundational software and platforms that enable the development, deployment, and operation of modern applications. This includes cloud infrastructure, DevOps tools, data platforms, and developer productivity solutions. Our investments in this space include **JFrog** (DevOps and DevSecOps), **CircleCI** (CI/CD), **Honeycomb** (observability), and **Cortex** (engineering system of record).

### Productivity
This area encompasses software that enhances individual and team productivity, streamlines business processes, and improves collaboration. We look for applications that make work more efficient, automate repetitive tasks, and provide better insights for decision-making. Companies like **Box** (content management), **Demandbase** (account-based marketing), and **DocuSign** (e-signatures) are key examples in our portfolio.

### Security
We invest in companies developing advanced software solutions to protect enterprises from evolving cyber threats. This includes identity and access management, data security, application security, and threat detection platforms. Our portfolio in Security features companies like **Expel** (managed detection and response) and **AppOmni** (SaaS security).

### Verticals
Beyond our core horizontal themes, we also invest in software companies that are building intelligent, vertical-specific applications tailored to the unique needs of particular industries. These solutions often leverage deep domain expertise to solve complex problems within sectors like logistics, healthcare, or real estate. **Airspace Technologies** (time-critical logistics) is an example of our investment in this area.
