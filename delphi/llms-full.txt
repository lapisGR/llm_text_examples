This consistency ensures a cohesive user experience across the entire site and provides additional context on Delphi's target markets.
*   **Hero Section (`Join us. We’re hiring humans.`):** This section immediately sets the tone, highlighting Delphi's unique value proposition: scaling human expertise. It presents the problem (static content vs. personalized guidance) and Delphi's solution (scaling in-demand experts).
    *   **Call to Action (CTA):** A prominent "See open positions" button links directly to the `#roles` section on the same page, ensuring a smooth user journey for interested candidates. This internal anchor link (`./careers#roles`) is a best practice for improving user experience and reducing load times by avoiding a full page reload.

## Company Culture and Values {#company-culture-and-values}

This section is dedicated to articulating the core principles that define Delphi's work environment and employee expectations. It uses a clear list format to present each principle, fostering transparency and attracting candidates whose values align with the company's ethos.

*   **Principles We Live By:** These eight principles serve as the cultural bedrock of Delphi, guiding employee behavior and decision-making.
    *   **Focus on Inputs:** Emphasizes process-oriented thinking and consistent execution over outcome obsession.
    *   **Underdog Mentality:** Promotes agility, creative problem-solving, and resilience, encouraging a proactive and humble approach.
    *   **Antimimeticism:** Encourages first-principles thinking, questioning conventions, and rejecting copycat tendencies to foster true innovation.

## Career Opportunities {#career-opportunities}

This is the central section for job seekers, providing a categorized list of open positions and a unique interactive element.

*   **Interactive Job Exploration:** A unique and innovative feature is the prompt: "Tired of reading job descriptions? Learn more about a position by calling the CEO’s digital mind [here](https://www.delphi.ai/dara)!" This serves as a direct demonstration of Delphi's product in action, allowing candidates to interact with an AI-powered "digital mind" of the CEO to gain insights into roles and company culture. This "dogfooding" (using your own product) strategy builds confidence in the technology and provides an engaging candidate experience.

*   **External Application Links:** Each job title links directly to an external application platform (AshbyHQ), streamlining the application process. For example, the "Backend Product Engineer" role links to `https://jobs.ashbyhq.com/delphi/a027ea85-a8c5-4ea8-a5a6-e625c18f7328`. This integration with a specialized Applicant Tracking System (ATS) like AshbyHQ is a best practice for managing recruitment workflows efficiently and securely.

## Product Showcase: Create Your Digital Mind {#product-showcase}

Following the career opportunities, the page transitions into a direct promotion of Delphi's core product, reinforcing the company's mission and what employees would be building. This section serves as a powerful reminder of the company's core offering.

## Technical Considerations and Best Practices {#technical-considerations}

The implementation of the Careers page demonstrates several technical best practices for web development and content delivery, contributing to a high-quality user experience.

*   **Responsive Design:** The implied use of Framer (indicated by `framerusercontent.com` image URLs) suggests a focus on responsive design principles. This ensures the page renders optimally across various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile), providing a consistent experience for all users.
*   **Image Optimization:** All images (`.webp` format) are served from `framerusercontent.com`, indicating the use of a Content Delivery Network (CDN). WebP is a modern image format offering superior compression for both lossy and lossless compression, leading to faster page load times and reduced bandwidth consumption.
    *   **Example:** `https://framerusercontent.com/images/E2afVlQsVIsygCISraPDLmguZs.webp`
    *   **Best Practice:** While not explicitly verifiable from the provided content, implementing lazy loading for images not immediately in the viewport would further enhance initial page load performance.
*   **External Integrations:**
    *   **AshbyHQ:** The seamless integration with AshbyHQ for job applications demonstrates efficient use of third-party services for specialized functionalities (Applicant Tracking System). This offloads the complexity of managing applications directly on Delphi's servers, allowing them to focus on core product development.
    *   **Delphi's Own Product:** The link to `https://www.delphi.ai/dara` (the CEO's digital mind) is a clever and effective way to showcase the product's capabilities directly on a recruitment page. This "dogfooding" strategy builds confidence in the technology and provides a unique interactive element for candidates.
*   **Semantic HTML and SEO:** The consistent use of `##` for main sections (translating to `<h2>` in HTML) and `###` for sub-sections (translating to `<h3>`) implies a well-structured HTML document. This semantic structuring is crucial for search engine optimization (SEO) and accessibility, allowing screen readers and search engine crawlers to better understand the page content hierarchy and improve discoverability.
*   **Clear Calls to Action (CTAs):** Multiple, strategically placed CTAs (`See open positions`, `Get Started`) guide user interaction effectively. The use of internal anchor links for "See open positions" improves navigation within the page, reducing friction.
*   **Consistent Branding:** The page maintains consistent branding elements (logo, color scheme, tone of voice) with the rest of the Delphi website, reinforcing brand identity and providing a cohesive user experience.

## Cross-Referencing and Documentation Integration {#cross-referencing}

This Careers page is designed to be part of a larger documentation set and website ecosystem, with numerous internal and external links that enhance its utility and provide a comprehensive user journey.

*   **Internal Links:**
    *   **Pricing:** Links to `./pricing` are present in both the top navigation and the "Create your Digital Mind" section, encouraging prospective users (who might also be job seekers) to explore the product's commercial aspects.
    *   **Explore:** Links to `https://www.delphi.ai/explore` provide access to examples or demonstrations of Delphi's technology in action, showcasing the product's capabilities.
    *   **About:** The footer links to `./about`, which would likely provide more detailed information on the company's history, leadership, and broader mission.
    *   **Blog:** The footer links to `./blog`, offering insights into company news, industry trends, and thought leadership, which can further engage potential candidates.
    *   **Documentation:** The footer explicitly links to `https://docs.delphi.ai/home`, indicating a dedicated documentation portal where this page's technical documentation would reside. This ensures users can find comprehensive information about the product and company.
    *   **Industries:** Links to specific industry pages (e.g., `./industries/experts`, `./industries/coaches`) help candidates understand the target market for Delphi's product and its diverse applications.
*   **External Links:**
    *   **AshbyHQ:** Links to `jobs.ashbyhq.com` for job applications, leveraging a specialized external platform for recruitment management.
    *   **Delphi's Digital Mind:** Links to `https://www.delphi.ai/dara` as a live product demonstration, providing a unique interactive experience.

This extensive internal and external linking strategy ensures that the Careers page is not an isolated entity but a well-integrated component of Delphi's overall web presence, providing a rich and interconnected user experience for both job seekers and potential customers.

## Getting Started with Delphi {#getting-started}

Regardless of the chosen tier, the process of bringing your Digital Mind to life follows a consistent, intuitive three-step journey. This section outlines these steps, providing a high-level overview of the initial setup process. For detailed instructions, please refer to the [Getting Started Guide](/docs/getting-started).

### 01. Connect Your Content {#connect-content}

This initial phase involves feeding your Digital Mind with the knowledge it needs to represent you. Delphi is designed to ingest a wide variety of content formats.

*   **Process:** Upload documents (PDFs, Word docs), link to videos (YouTube), podcasts, articles, or connect live feeds (RSS).
*   **Technical Note:** The system automatically transcribes audio/video and extracts text from documents, converting it into a format suitable for AI training. The volume of content you can connect is limited by your tier's [training words capacity](#training-words-details).

### 02. Train and Customize {#train-customize}

Once your content is connected, you'll refine your Digital Mind's personality, tone, and specific behaviors.

*   **Process:** Mirror your unique tone and style, define how your Digital Mind should respond to certain queries, and add specific instructions or "notes" on what it should prioritize or avoid. This phase is crucial for ensuring the Digital Mind accurately reflects your brand and expertise.
*   **Technical Note:** This involves fine-tuning the AI model's parameters and adding contextual rules. For advanced customization, Scaler and Unlimited tiers offer more granular control and potentially access to professional voice options.

### 03. Share Everywhere {#share-everywhere}

The final step is to deploy your Digital Mind where your audience can interact with it.

*   **Process:** Embed your Digital Mind on your website, share its dedicated Delphi page, integrate it into messaging platforms (SMS, WhatsApp for Unlimited), or deploy it via custom integrations.
*   **Technical Note:** Deployment options vary by tier, with higher tiers offering more "locations" and advanced integration capabilities (e.g., custom domains, API access). Ensure your deployment strategy aligns with your audience's preferred communication channels.

## [User Registration Form](#user-registration-form)

The central component of this page is the user registration form, designed to capture essential information for creating a new affiliate account.

### [Form Fields](#form-fields)

The form includes the following input fields, each with specific validation requirements:

*   **First name:**
    *   **Type:** Text
    *   **Requirement:** Mandatory
    *   **Validation:** Alphanumeric characters, typically limited in length (e.g., 2-50 characters).
*   **Last name:**
    *   **Type:** Text
    *   **Requirement:** Mandatory
    *   **Validation:** Alphanumeric characters, typically limited in length (e.g., 2-50 characters).
*   **Email:**
    *   **Type:** Email
    *   **Requirement:** Mandatory
    *   **Validation:** Must conform to standard email address format (e.g., `user@example.com`). Server-side validation also checks for uniqueness (no duplicate email registrations) and potentially for disposable email addresses.
*   **Password:**
    *   **Type:** Password
    *   **Requirement:** Mandatory
    *   **Validation:** See [Password Policy](#password-policy) below.
*   **Confirm password:**
    *   **Type:** Password
    *   **Requirement:** Mandatory
    *   **Validation:** Must exactly match the value entered in the "Password" field. This is a client-side and typically server-side validation to prevent typos.

### [Password Policy](#password-policy)

The password field includes a hint: "Minimum 8 characters, ideally more." This indicates the baseline requirement for user-defined passwords.

**Best Practices for Password Security:**
*   **Minimum Length:** Enforced at 8 characters.
*   **Complexity:** While not explicitly stated on the UI, the backend system should ideally enforce or strongly recommend a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters for enhanced security.
*   **Hashing:** Passwords are never stored in plain text. Upon submission, passwords are cryptographically hashed using a strong, slow hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with a unique salt for each user.
*   **No Re-use:** Users should be discouraged from re-using passwords across multiple services.

## [Existing User Login](#existing-user-login)

Below the registration form, a clear link is provided for users who already have an account: "Already have an account? [Login](/login)". This link directs users to the dedicated login page, streamlining the access process for returning affiliates.

**Cross-reference:** For detailed information on the login process and authentication mechanisms, refer to the [Delphi AI User Login Page Documentation (Page 4)](/docs/user-login).

## [Technical Considerations](#technical-considerations)

This section outlines the underlying technical aspects of the registration process, including data handling, validation, and security.

### [Data Validation and Submission](#data-validation-and-submission)

*   **Client-Side Validation:** Implemented using JavaScript to provide immediate feedback to the user regarding invalid input (e.g., incorrect email format, non-matching passwords, empty required fields). This enhances user experience by reducing server round-trips for common errors.
*   **Server-Side Validation:** Crucial for data integrity and security. All submitted data is re-validated on the server to ensure it meets business rules and security requirements, regardless of client-side validation. This includes:
    *   Checking for unique email addresses.
    *   Enforcing password policy.
    *   Sanitizing inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
*   **HTTP Method:** The form submission uses the `POST` method to securely transmit user data to the backend server.
*   **Expected Responses:**
    *   **HTTP 200 OK:** For successful registration, typically followed by a redirect.
    *   **HTTP 400 Bad Request:** For validation errors (e.g., invalid email, password not meeting criteria, email already registered). The response body should contain specific error messages.
    *   **HTTP 500 Internal Server Error:** For unexpected server-side issues.
*   **Error Handling:** User-friendly error messages are displayed prominently on the page to guide users in correcting their input. For server-side errors, generic messages may be shown, with detailed errors logged internally for debugging.

### [Security Best Practices](#security-best-practices)

*   **HTTPS Encryption:** All data transmitted to and from the page is encrypted using HTTPS, protecting sensitive information (passwords, personal details) from interception.
*   **Password Hashing:** As mentioned in [Password Policy](#password-policy), passwords are never stored in plain text.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implementations should include rate limiting on registration attempts to mitigate brute-force attacks and prevent spam registrations.
*   **CAPTCHA/reCAPTCHA:** While not explicitly visible on the provided content, integrating a CAPTCHA solution (e.g., Google reCAPTCHA v3) is a recommended best practice to prevent automated bot registrations.
*   **Session Management:** Upon successful registration/login, a secure session is established using industry-standard practices (e.g., secure, HTTP-only cookies, proper session expiration).

### [Post-Registration/Login Flow](#post-registrationlogin-flow)

*   **Successful Registration:**
    1.  User data is stored securely in the database.
    2.  A welcome email (and potentially an email verification link) is sent to the registered email address.
    3.  The user is typically automatically logged in and redirected to their affiliate dashboard or a welcome page.
*   **Successful Login:**
    1.  User credentials are authenticated against stored hashes.
    2.  A secure session is established.
    3.  The user is redirected to their affiliate dashboard.
*   **Failed Attempts:**
    1.  Appropriate error messages are displayed (e.g., "Invalid email or password," "Email already registered").
    2.  No sensitive information (like which specific field was incorrect) is revealed to prevent enumeration attacks.
    3.  Login attempts are logged for security monitoring.

## [Best Practices and Troubleshooting](#best-practices-and-troubleshooting)

**For Users:**
*   **Strong Passwords:** Always use a unique, strong password that meets or exceeds the minimum requirements. Consider using a password manager.
*   **Email Verification:** Check your spam/junk folder for the welcome or verification email after registration.
*   **Browser Compatibility:** Ensure your browser is up-to-date for optimal performance and security.

**For Developers/Administrators:**
*   **Monitor Logs:** Regularly review server logs for registration errors, failed login attempts, and suspicious activity.
*   **Update Validation Rules:** Keep client-side and server-side validation rules synchronized and updated based on evolving security threats or business requirements.
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Monitor page load times and form submission latency to ensure a smooth user experience.
*   **Accessibility:** Ensure the form fields and instructions are accessible to users with disabilities (e.g., proper ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
