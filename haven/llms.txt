# Haven

At Haven, we are dedicated to rebuilding accounting operations for founders and growing businesses, by founders themselves. We offer a tech-forward approach to bookkeeping, tax services, and tax credits, simplifying complex financials so you can focus on what matters most: growing your business. Unlike traditional accounting firms, we integrate seamlessly as an extension of your team, providing year-round support and proactive financial guidance.

## Our Approach

We believe that staying on top of your finances is crucial for any business, but founders often lack the time or specific expertise to manage it effectively. That's where Haven steps in. We ensure your company's finances are accurate and optimized from the start, providing peace of mind and clarity. Our unique value proposition lies in our accessibility and dedication; we create **dedicated Slack channels** for our clients, allowing for immediate, year-round answers to your questions, rather than making you wait weeks for a scheduled call. This commitment to client-centric service is core to our philosophy, as our CEO, **Cyrus Shirazi**, emphasizes, "If we do the little things right and prioritize the customer over all else, the rest will take care of itself."

Since our inception in **March of 2023**, Haven has rapidly grown, serving **north of 45 clients** and helping them save **millions of dollars** through strategic tax benefits, such as **R&D Tax Credits**. We are based in **New York** and proudly serve clients all across the **United States**. Learn more about how easy it is to get started with us at [usehaven.com](https://www.usehaven.com/).

Our robust security measures are designed to protect the data you entrust with us, providing transparency about our practices while maintaining operational integrity. We invite you to review our detailed [security page](https://www.usehaven.com/legal/security) for a full understanding of our protocols.

## Our Platform & Security Measures

Our platform is built with a multi-layered security approach, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of your financial information. We believe in transparency regarding our security practices, empowering you to make informed decisions about your data protection.

### Web Server Security
Haven's web infrastructure employs **end-to-end encryption** through **HTTPS** with **SSL connections**, specifically utilizing the industry-leading **TLSv1.3 protocol** for all data transmission. Our system architecture is designed as a **closed system**, meaning our API endpoints are almost exclusively internal-facing. They can only be accessed through Haven's internal infrastructure, effectively eliminating potential vectors for unauthorized external access and ensuring your sensitive financial data remains encrypted and inaccessible outside our secure environment.

### User Authentication
Robust authentication and granular access controls form a key pillar of Havenâ€™s security model. We have implemented a comprehensive authentication system through **Clerk**, which mandates **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for all user access to our application. Our access control framework adheres to a **role-based model**, strictly following the **principle of least privilege**. This ensures that users are granted only the permissions necessary for their specific functions, meaning even within Haven, your data is only accessible to those explicitly authorized for their duties.

### Data Access Controls
To maintain the highest level of data protection, Haven has implemented stringent access boundaries around all customer information. Data can only be accessed by **authenticated users and partners**, with resources strictly limited to retrieval and updates by their rightful owners. Furthermore, **database access is strictly limited to authorized connections through Google Cloud's secure infrastructure**, reinforcing our commitment to data privacy and security.
