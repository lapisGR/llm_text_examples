This directory contains AI-enhanced LLMS documentation for three companies, generated with the V2 Vercel-style generator.

## Results Summary

#### llms-full.txt (V2)
- **Length**: 28,625 chars
- **Pages**: 28
- **Avg/page**: 1,022 chars
- **V2 Quality**: Below target (1,022 < 3,000 chars/page)
- **Reason**: Limited source content from pre-launch website

## V2 Generator Analysis

### What's Working Well:
1. ✓ **V2 is deployed** and generating enhanced content
2. ✓ **AI enhancement** working for both file types
3. ✓ **Proper structure** with metadata blocks
4. ✓ **Professional documentation** style
5. ✓ **Attribution** included in all files

### Areas for Improvement:
1. **Content Length**: Pages averaging 1,000-2,000 chars instead of 3,000-5,000
2. **Variability**: Quality depends heavily on source website content
3. **Pre-launch Sites**: Limited content (like Optivolt) produces minimal documentation

### Why Lower Chars/Page:
- Some websites have limited content (Optivolt is pre-launch)
- V2 generator creates many focused pages rather than fewer comprehensive ones
- The 3-5K target might be better achieved with fewer, more consolidated pages

## File Structure

Each company folder contains:
```
company_name/
├── llms.txt          # AI-enhanced Profound-style
├── llms-full.txt     # V2 AI-enhanced Vercel-style
└── sample_page.md    # Sample page from llms-full.txt
```

## Conclusion

The V2 generator is working correctly and producing AI-enhanced documentation. While the per-page character count is below the 3-5K target, the overall quality is good with proper structure, professional tone, and comprehensive coverage. The variation in output quality reflects the differences in source website content richness.

For content-rich sites (like Vercel.com tested earlier), the V2 generator produces closer to 3K chars/page. For simpler sites, it adapts by creating more focused, shorter pages.
